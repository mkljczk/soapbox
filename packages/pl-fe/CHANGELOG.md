# Changelog

## Unreleased

Changes made since the project forked from Soapbox in April 2024.

### Major changes

- Switched to a separate library [`pl-api`](https://github.com/mkljczk/pl-fe/tree/develop/packages/pl-api) for Mastodon API integration. It is mostly written from scratch, inheriting minor code parts from Soapbox/Mastodon. This also comes with improved compatibility with various Mastodon API extensions and abstracts out the implementation details.

### Added

**Behavior:**
- Notifications of the same type and reposts of the same post are grouped client-side.
- Date is displayed for notifications that are not about new posts.
- Replies to your posts are displayed differently to other mentions in notification list.
- Hashtags from the last line of a post are displayed in a separate component. Adapted [from Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/26499).
- Native grouped notifications are used on Mastodon.

**Settings:**
- You can add image description to your avatar/backend, if supported by backend.
- GoToSocial users can manage post interaction policies.
- Users caan set interface theme color.

**Composing posts:**
- WYSIWYG text formatting, available if Markdown is supported.
- When writing posts, links to statuses are added as quotes, when supported by backend.
- You can select post language manually, when composing.
- You can write posts with multiple language versions, when supported by backend.
- Language detection is done client-side for composed posts, utilizing `fasttext.wasm.js`.
- Draft posts. They are stored locally only and work with any backend.
- New visibility scopes are supported â€“ local-only and list-only for Pleroma. Local-only is a separate switch on GoToSocial.
- On backends that support explicit mentioning, you can choose to include mentions in your replies body.
- GoToSocial users can set per-post interaction policies.

**Features:**
- The most recent scrobble is displayed on user profile/card.
- Users can generate *interaction circles* for their profiles.
- You can bite users, if supported by backend.
- You can browse Bubble timeline, if supported by backend.
- Mastodon displays trending articles on Search page.
- Posts can be addressed to lists of users, on Pleroma.
- Support for events with external registration.
- Added a dedicated wrench reaction button.
- Interaction requests are supported. You can review pending requests and you get informed if your backend doesn't let you reply to a post. Supported on GoToSocial.
- Events with external sign up are supported.
- Application name used to post a status is displayed.

### Changed

**Behavior:**
- Separated favourites from reaction emojis. Limit for one reaction per post is removed. Facebook-like emoji reaction bar is removed.
- Simplified sensitive text/media logic.
- Reposting user is mentioned, when replying to a reposted status.
- Notification types filtering options are reasonably merged.
- Search results are never cleared by just leaving the page.
- Status spoilers are displayed with a collapse/expand button, not in an overlay.

**Settings:**

**Internal:**

- Posts are now emojified during render, instead of when inserting posts to the state.
- Barrel exports are no longer used.
- Search page uses URL params now.

**Dependencies:**
