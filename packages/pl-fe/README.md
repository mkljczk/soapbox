`pl-fe` is a social networking client app. It works with any Mastodon API-compatible software, but it's focused on supporting alternative backends, like Pleroma or GoToSocial.

## Try it out

Want to test `pl-fe` with **any existing MastoAPI-compatible server?** Try [pl.mkljczk.pl](https://pl.mkljczk.pl) â€” enter your server's domain name to use `pl-fe` on any server!

If you want to use `pl-fe` as the default frontend on your server, download the latest build from [pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip](http://pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip) and install it following the instructions for your backend. For example, on a standard Pleroma installation you can use:

```sh
curl -O https://pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip
unzip pl-fe.zip -d /opt/pleroma/instance/static/
rm pl-fe.zip
```

**Note**: Some Fediverse software (Akkoma, Mitra) use Content Security Policy configuration which disallows the usage of inline styles, which are used by pl-fe for color schemes. [Mangane README](https://github.com/BDX-town/Mangane/) suggests using server configuration to override the default CSP header:
>
> Here is an example configuration for nginx:
> ```
> # add style-src for mangane
> proxy_hide_header Content-Security-Policy;
> add_header Content-Security-Policy "upgrade-insecure-requests;script-src 'self';connect-src 'self' blob: https://example.com wss://example.com;media-src 'self' https:;img-src 'self' data: blob: https:;default-src 'none';base-uri 'self';frame-ancestors 'none';style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';font-src 'self';manifest-src 'self';" always;
> ```
> *Please replace https://example.com with your own domain*
